USA V1 - June 2023
: Initial release

USA V2 - Oct 2023
: Added Square Root elevation scale models.
: Released Alaska
: Improved alignment between state borders and dual color print objects.
: Death Valley, CA and other inland below sea level locations are now at the correct elevations instead holes.
: Increased 3MF model precision from 4 to 6 decimal places.
: Maps now import into slicers at the correct size.
: 3D model previews on Printables.com now show in contrasting colors.

USA V2.1 - NOV 2023
: Reuploaded certain models in CO, OH, OK, NE, NV, MI, ID, AZ, KS, GA that did not compress correctly with 7zip.
: V2.1 map filenames are versioned as `v2` and directly replace V2 maps.

USA V2.2 - **Storage Optimized Maps & Low Poly style Maps** - DEC 2024 ðŸš§
: Reuploaded all V2 maps in storage optimized version.
: Uploaded Low Poly style maps.
: V2.2 map filenames are versioned as `v2` and directly replace V2/V2.1 maps.
: All maps are lower size (~60%) for faster downloading and processing. The maps retain the original amount of detail.
: Low Poly maps are based off USA V2.1
: Low Poly map borders are compatible with all USA V2.1 maps. The elevation features are transformed to be more "triangular/pixelated" for an abstract aesthetic. Precise borders and dual color hygrography are maintained.
: The land and stream transition on this first version of Low Poly maps is a bit abrupt but should not make a huge difference in the final print.
: These new maps download and slice almost 100% faster.
