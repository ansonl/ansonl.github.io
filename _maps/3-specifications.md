[Updated 3D Map Model Release Notes](https://ansonliu.com/maps/release-notes/)

[3D Print Settings](https://ansonliu.com/maps/print-settings/)

{% include_relative makerworld-size-limit.md %}

Unless otherwise specified for specific maps, I have designed the models for a 0.4 mm nozzle diameter and 0.08-0.12mm layer heights. Recommended print settings are any multiples of these specs but other nozzle sizes (and line widths) will print well too.

> ðŸ“¢ **Cautionary Remark on Accuracy:** You may find other [small scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(map)#Large_scale,_medium_scale,_small_scale) maps with the description of "most detailed/accurate/quality models available" mixed in terms like LIDAR and satellite. These claims often lack quantifiable resolution and scale. My published maps' specifications are tracked throughout stages of GIS and 3D processing. A modern FDM printer from Bambu Lab or Ultimaker will print near indistinguishable results between 0.1mm map models and 10x downscaled resolution as coarse as 1mm â€” determined through testing. **If you are printing landscape maps covering wider than a city â‰¥50km (31mi), the map projection, smoothing, and scale have a greater effect on the final map detail and appearance.**

## Map Variants Comparison

My maps are created with 2 different elevation scale styles.

![map variant comparison](/assets/images/maps/map-variants-comparison.png)

**Linear Scale (`linear`):** reflects the true elevation with a constant multiplier applied evenly across all the entire map to show sufficient detail.

**Logarithmic Scale (incl: Square Root `sqrt`):** exagerrates elevation differences in flat locations while smoothing out the pointyness of extreme elevations. Elevation detail is enhanced across the entire map at the cost of decreased accuracy.

## Model Filename Chart

The map model style can be decoded and sorted by the filename.

| Definition | Meaning |
| ---- | ---- |
| `REGION` | REGION Abbreviation |
| `ESCALING` | Elevation scaling (e.g., `linear` or `sqrt` or `log`) |
| `EXTRUDER` | `dual` or `single` color (extrusion) model |
| `STYLE`* *(optional)* | Model special style or subregion. (e.g. `transparent`) `STYLE` is only present when the model file is a special style or the model is exclusive to a special subregion. |
| `REVISION` | Revision number in the format `Vxx` where `xx` is the version. See [release notes](https://ansonliu.com/maps/release-notes/) for the latest improvements. |
| `POSTPROCESS` *(optional)* | Secondary style (e.g.,`lowpoly`) based on a map `VARIANT` combination. |
| `PIECE##`â€  *(optional)* | Interlocking pre-cut piece ## sized for 180 mm x 180 mm or 256mm x 256mm bed. |

**Default `STYLE` is water features model located over submerged low lying lands. This submerged land may be visible when water layers are printed with a transparent filament. Default style minimizes usage of secondary (water) filament color. `transparent` style has water model features that extend all the way through the land for maximum light transmission when used with glow and transparent filaments.*

â€ *If multi-part files are not present, I have not created interlocking models for this state yet. Follow me on MakerWorld/Printables and comment with your request to get future additions and updates.*
