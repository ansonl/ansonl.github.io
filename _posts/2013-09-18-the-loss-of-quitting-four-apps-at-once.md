I saw this screenshot comparison on [Wired ][1]which allows me to mention a point which I was not going to mention due to the hassle of taking the screenshots myself. *Thanks, Kif!*

Using iOS 6, you could quit four apps at once by pressing four fingers on the four red minus signs. This wasn&#8217;t a big deal, but could be fun if you had many apps open at the same time and they would zoom past you.  
Now iOS 7 multitasking only allows the simultaneous quitting of up to three apps at a time using a three fingered upwards swipe.
