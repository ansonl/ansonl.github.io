I downloaded <a rel="nofollow" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ultraviolet-dawn-lite/id414687415?mt=12">UltraViolet Dawn lite</a> from the Mac App Store and was playing in it until the app prompted me to buy the full version. I had the game on my iPhone already and had no intention of buying the desktop version in the near future so I proceeded to quit the app.  
Uninstalling it was trickier. I owned a copy of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.appzapper.com/">AppZapper</a> but using it would be too easy so I assumed that Apple would give users the option of uninstalling their apps in the App Store app.

Turned out there wasn&#8217;t; which is an inconvenience to those who don&#8217;t have AppZapper. A bundled uninstall tool would be useful tool for Windows users switching over to the Mac. Perhaps apple will include something of the sort in the future.
