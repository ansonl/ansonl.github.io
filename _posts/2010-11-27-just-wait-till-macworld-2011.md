I bet many Macworld attendees are getting an iPhone Life expiration notice in the mail. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-282" title="iPhone Life expiration flier" src="https://i0.wp.com/apparentetch.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/iPhone-Life-expiration-flier.jpeg?resize=300%2C388" alt="iPhone Life expiration flier" data-recalc-dims="1" />At this year&#8217;s expo, the iPhone Life booth ran out of free magazines and allowed visitors to order a free copy online. We filled out our email on a form and they emailed us a link to a payment site for a copy of iPhone Life. The payment site listed the price of the subscription as $0.00.

A few weeks later, I got the free magazine. For some reason — I still don&#8217;t know — iPhone Life also sent me an email about getting the magazine free on Zinio and getting monthly print subscriptions. I absentmindedly sifted through these emails as promotional material. From February until now, November, I&#8217;ve been getting regular issues of iPhone Life. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with it — to me, of course.

I&#8217;ve been enjoying reading my free issues iPhone Life so far and think that it&#8217;s an informative magazine. The articles about developers are interesting to read. Hopefully at Macworld 2011, I might be able to get another &#8220;free copy&#8221;.
