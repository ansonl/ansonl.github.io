I was making a website for an organization where individuals could upload their own files into their own folders. However, php has nefarious uses when placed in the wrong hands.

I found that php can be disabled in a directory by adding

`RemoveHandler .php .phtml .php3`  
and  
`RemoveType .php .phtml .php3`

to the `.htaccess` file in the target directory. Even better, this method is recursive and disables php in sub directories. Surprisingly, .htaccess file in a sub directory doesn&#8217;t override this setting.
