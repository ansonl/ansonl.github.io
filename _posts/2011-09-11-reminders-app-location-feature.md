One problem with using a location for a task in Reminders is that you can only select a location from your contacts list. You can&#8217;t select a location on a map or enter in an address. I&#8217;ll submit a feature request if I get time.

<img title="location select.PNG" src="https://i1.wp.com/apparentetch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/location-select1.png?resize=200%2C300" border="0" alt="Location select" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img title="contact location.PNG" src="https://i1.wp.com/apparentetch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/contact-location.png?resize=200%2C300" border="0" alt="Contact location" data-recalc-dims="1" />

Also, even though there is probably not a better way to do this, the Reminders app uses your location continuously if you have a location based alert set up. It appears to check roughly every minute with low accuracy.

Yesterday, I was across town ~ 5 miles from the location of one of my tasks and it alerted me twice in a row.
