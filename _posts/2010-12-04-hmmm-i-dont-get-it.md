The other day, I was browsing my friend&#8217;s Android phone. I saw an app installed named &#8220;Battery Booster&#8221;. Interested in how it worked, I opened it. Then one of the preferences caught my eye, it said

<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-310" title="battery booster" src="https://i1.wp.com/apparentetch.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/battery-booster.jpg?resize=200%2C268" alt="battery booster" data-recalc-dims="1" />  
> **Security Level**</p> 
> Select low level to save more battery, or high level to keep system more stable

I&#8217;m guessing that the app would quit other apps that weren&#8217;t being used much or were sucking up too much power. While that makes sense to a degree, it&#8217;s a scary thought to an iOS developer. One app can quit another?! I wouldn&#8217;t want an app quitting a running process for the sake of &#8220;saving more battery&#8221;.

Another seemingly wasteful function was a low battery light. The phone was on low battery so a white light would glow on the top of the phone. I don&#8217;t see any need for this at all. If the phone is on low battery, don&#8217;t deplete the reserves even more with a useless light that you cannot turn off!  
  
I&#8217;m sure that the makers of the phone intended it to alert users, but I&#8217;m sure that I can see the battery bar at the top of the screen.
