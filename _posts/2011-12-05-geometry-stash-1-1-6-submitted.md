<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1170" title="Input & Output folders" src="https://i0.wp.com/apparentetch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/nice.png?resize=98%2C78" alt="Input & Output folders" data-recalc-dims="1" />Automator was used to quickly convert the files enmasse. We created the iPad&#8217;s term diagram images at the same aspect ratio as the iPhone version&#8217;s. This way, it was a simple matter of resizing the image&#8217;s widths as 640px (in this case).

&#8211; The image files were pointed to the script by using Automator&#8217;s built in Folder Actions. The input was any file dropping into the &#8216;input&#8217; folder.  
&#8211; Image was resized to 640px using **Scale Images**  
&#8211; Appended &#8216;@2x&#8217; to the filename usind **Add Text**  
<small>Note: Appending &#8216;@2x&#8217; is just an easy way of pointing retina display devices to the hi-res image.</small>  
&#8211; The final step was to move the &#8220;finished&#8221; file into the &#8216;output&#8217; folder in order to avoid confusion. Used **Move Finder Items**

&#8211; You can import the files into Xcode afterwards. *Drag n drop*
