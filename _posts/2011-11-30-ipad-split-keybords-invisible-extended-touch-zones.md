Surprise surprise, the iPad&#8217;s split keyboard includes &#8220;invisible&#8221; keys.

When you click slightly to the *right* of the *left hand side* keyboard, the *adjacent* letter on the *opposite side*&#8216;s keyboard is typed, vice versa.

Below is a diagram with the range and values of those zones.

  <small>For example, if you tapped to the right of the G key in the empty space, the H letter will be typed.</small>
</center>

Made to help those who don&#8217;t follow the standard keys-to-fingers, the extended touch zones have probably helped you a few times. And probably again now that you know about them!
