<p style="text-align: center;">
  The Virtual Pizza Network&#8217;s backend has been augmented with a UI.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  Access is found at <a href="http://VirtualPizzaNetwork.com" target="_blank">www.VirtualPizzaNetwork.com</a>. The pizza order system is optimized for WebKit run browsers such as Apple Safari or Google Chrome. Almost all of the site utilizes HTML5 and CSS3 for blazing fast rendering. Two image files are used if you even find them.
</p>

**Password hint:** Prefix of 3 + the Swedish word for fish  
Highlight to the right to reveal: <span style="color: white;"><em>trifisk</em></span>

If you have an iOS or other mobile device, you might not be able to customize your pizza for evaluation. But you may still login and submit your credentials.

Explore the site, customize your pizza, and have a great summer.
