Have you tried <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/one-single-life/id417890518?mt=8" target="_blank">One Single Life</a> by FreshTone Games? Died yet and wanted another life? When you clicked Continue on the tombstone, you sure were disappointed to see the credits, weren&#8217;t you?  
Should&#8217;ve rolled through the credits.  
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-606" title="Those with faith" src="https://i1.wp.com/apparentetch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_0249.png?resize=400%2C267" alt="Those with faith will be rewarded." data-recalc-dims="1" />  
Looking at all the one star reviews by disgruntled users, it&#8217;s sad that most of the users don&#8217;t want to see the credits, much less read them. FreshTone Games stepped out and stuck the credits in front of the users&#8217; faces. As it turned out, *those with faith (or patience) will be rewarded*.
