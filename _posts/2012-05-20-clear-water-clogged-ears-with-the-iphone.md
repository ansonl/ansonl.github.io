I wish that I had discovered this earlier. The iPhone&#8217;s speaker can clear water clogged ears.

My ear was blocked by some water after a shower and I went outside for a walk afterwards with <a href="https://www.zombiesrungame.com/" target="_blank">Zombies, Run!</a> running on my iPhone. I held the speaker of the phone up to my ear, about 1 cm away, to hear one of the voiceovers and the dome of water plugging up the ear broke down.

My best guess is that the <a href="http://faculty.rcoe.appstate.edu/goodmanjm/asuscienceed/background/waterdrops/waterdrops.html" target="_blank">cohesion</a> of water in the ear was weakened by the varying frequencies of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_wave" target="_blank">longitudinal waves</a> emitted from the iPhone. The speaking voice from the voiceover in Zombies, Run! varied from low to high frequency at a regular rate and further helped the breakdown of water dome in the ear.
