The last 3 weeks I&#8217;ve taken up a pet project. I&#8217;ll call it SCIAF for now. It includes the basics of a classic desktop game.

SCIAF runs in your web browser. It&#8217;s coded using standards and widely used frameworks. We&#8217;re talking Scriptaculous here, jQuery just don&#8217;t cut it.  
HTML, CSS, Javascript, the simple usual. It&#8217;s interesting to play and easy to edit or add to. I&#8217;ve done my best to comment and make the code as readable and flexible as I can.

Most of the basic functions of SCIAF have been set down and are able to be expanded upon if given enough time.

I bet you want the code; you can get it on <a href="https://github.com/ansonl/SCIAF" target="_blank">SCIAF&#8217;s GitHub repo</a>. I update the code as new features are added. If you need help with the code, let me [know][3].

No? **You want to try it out?**  
Point your browser to <del><a title="SCIAF Demo" href="http://ansonliu.com/sc" target="_blank">http://ansonliu.com/sc</a></del>.  
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Link is no longer active, please download the source from <a href="https://github.com/ansonl/SCIAF" target="_blank"><span style="color: #ff0000;">GitHub </span></a>and run it locally in your browser.</span>

<small><em>SCIAF works best with Chrome and Safari. As long as Steve Ballmer doesn&#8217;t like CSS positioning, there will be no IE support.</em></small>
