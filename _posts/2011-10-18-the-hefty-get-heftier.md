No, I didn&#8217;t get a better idea for my Blog Action Day 2011 post.

Remember **iOS 1.1.x** (or iPhone OS, as it was called)? Upgrading it took next to no time, the roughly *200MB* file downloaded in no time.  
<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-981" title="ZiPhone" src="https://i2.wp.com/apparentetch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/ziphone_resize.jpeg?resize=100%2C150" alt="ZiPhone" data-recalc-dims="1" />

Those of us who who used <a href="http://ziphone.org" target="_blank">ZiPhone</a> or a <a href="http://jailbreakme.com" target="_blank">tiff exploit</a> to jailbreak our primitive devices never worried about storing our IPSWs or finding out where they were.

Even if you were forced to redownload the IPSW, it didn&#8217;t take too long. Uploading the IPSW to the devices took next to no time. Five minutes to restore and reboot, at the most.  I remember reinstalling a jailbroken version of iOS 1.1.3 a couple times per day if I messed it up by downloading something with unintended effects. It was simply faster nuke and send the firmware to the device than to solve a single problem.

Then came i**OS 2.x** with a slightly bigger baggage. *~250MB*. This opened the world of the App Store. 5omb wasn&#8217;t much of a trade off considering it included the App Store and the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080203224256/http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/jan08update.html" target="_blank">January &#8217;08</a> update for iPod Touches.

**iOS 3.x** came and passed without much of an increase in space. Major changes were in-app purchases and push notifications. The biggest parts of push notifications happened on Apple&#8217;s servers. Devices just received the notifs.

<img class="size-full wp-image-999 alignright" title="HUD" src="https://i1.wp.com/apparentetch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/hud.png?resize=320%2C93" alt="HUD" data-recalc-dims="1" /><span style="direction: ltr;"><strong>iOS 4.x</strong> landed with a staggering increase to <em>~570MB</em> in IPSW size. It contained &#8220;multitasking&#8221; and the HUD. </span>

The latest, **iOS 5.0** entered the arena with *~800MB* of improvements. Notification center, iMessage, and more were included.  
<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1011" title="iMessage" src="https://i1.wp.com/apparentetch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/imessage_icon.jpg?resize=62%2C62" alt="iMessage" data-recalc-dims="1" />      <img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1012" title="Notification Center" src="https://i0.wp.com/apparentetch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/notification_center_icon.jpg?resize=62%2C62" alt="Notification Center" data-recalc-dims="1" />  
Besides Siri, iOS 5 was more of a catchup and maintenance update to include competitors&#8217; features and streamline existing ones.

I don&#8217;t know of any new features that Apple would implement, but Apple probably has more ideas in the hangars for the next few years. Even if they didn&#8217;t, engaging in a better specs race with competitors would continue to generate revenue.

Apple has upped the devices&#8217; power from 620MHz ARM processors to 1GHz customized [ARM] A4 and A5&#8217;s. Memory has increased fourfold since the first release of the iPhone and iPod Touch.

<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1006" title="OS X" src="https://i2.wp.com/apparentetch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/60px-OSXLeopard.png?resize=60%2C72" alt="OS X" data-recalc-dims="1" />Just in case you&#8217;re interested, OS X has seen an increase in size from a mere *800MB* to *9GB*. In 7 versions, the size is grown 11x.

Perhaps we&#8217;ll be downloading 1GB and greater firmware files to upgrade our devices with. Even with iOS 5&#8217;s built in update feature, a major update —say iOS 6 — will most likely require plugging the device into the computer.

If you want, you \*could\* relate this insight to width factors challenging affluent countries.
