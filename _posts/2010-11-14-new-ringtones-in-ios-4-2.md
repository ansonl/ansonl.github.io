In all the fanfare over the iPad version of iOS 4.2. The 4.2 for iPhone update is being suffocated. I was trying to to get my birds to memorize a ringtone today when I clicked on the SMS alert setting in the Settings app. The new SMS alerts play longer than the original alerts. These new additions seem much more creative than the original set, even though we still cannot select a custom sound to play.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-220" title="new text tones" src="https://i1.wp.com/apparentetch.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/new-text-tones.png?resize=200%2C169" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-222 alignnone" title="old text tones" src="https://i1.wp.com/apparentetch.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/old-text-tones.png?resize=200%2C169" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" />

As pictured, the alerts are grouped into &#8220;New&#8221; and &#8220;Original&#8221; groups.
