Well, it is now Plebe Parents Weekend here in Annapolis, Maryland and I&#8217;m still alive.

<img rel="slb_off" class="alignleft" title="Hi" src="https://ansonliu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/image-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />There&#8217;s still a week left of Plebe Summer (training) and the AC year, pronounced ACK (see what I did there) for academic year, starts right afterwards.

As of now, there appears to be no problem with me developing and being employed by the military. I&#8217;ll try to keep developing and posting to the blog throughout the year.

**Update 1 (8/21/12) -** Plebe Summer has ended and I&#8217;ve begun my studies at the academy. My schedule is pretty packed and I&#8217;m not allowed to keep a mac at the academy. Not much time or opportunity to develop during the week.  
I&#8217;ll be able to access a mac off the campus periodically during the weekends so most support and coding work will take place then.
