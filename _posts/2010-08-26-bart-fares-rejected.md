I currently have an app named BART Fares in review for the the App Store.

A few days ago, I received an email saying

> We&#8217;ve reviewed your application, but cannot post this version to the App Store because it includes an Apple trademark image. We have included additional details below to help explain the issue, and hope youâ€™ll consider revising and resubmitting your application.

I assumed that the trademarked image was an iPad image that I had positioned on a table to make the scene look like breakfast.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26" title="iPad on desk" src="https://i2.wp.com/apparentetch.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/iPad-on-desk.png?resize=250%2C375" alt="iPad on desk" data-recalc-dims="1" />

I replied to confirm the violation and ask about alternatives.

> The violation is the iPad on the desk, right? I can put a Dell laptop there and it will be fine, right?

Meanwhile, waiting for the reviewer&#8217;s reply, I drew a typical breakfast plate and placed it on the table in place of the iPad (I&#8217;d never put a Dell there).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30" title="Breakfast food on desk" src="https://i0.wp.com/apparentetch.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Breakfast-food-on-desk.png?resize=250%2C375" alt="Breakfast food on desk" data-recalc-dims="1" />

I&#8217;ve resubmitted BART Fares with the updated map and table. We&#8217;ll see if this revision clears the review.

**Update (08/30/10) -** BART Fares just got approved and is now live on the App Store! Get it [here][1].
