<a href="https://apparentetch.helpshift.com/" target="_blank">Helpshift</a> has invited Apparent Etch to use their new support system.

Helpshift&#8217;s system allows users to request directly from the device app. I will be working on implementing Helpshift into my apps this Thanksgivings break.

For now, the online support system is available and can be reached by clicking <a href="https://apparentetch.helpshift.com/" target="_blank">Help</a> in the menu at the top of the page. This system is bound to increase support efficiency, can&#8217;t wait to try it out!
