For the last two weeks, I&#8217;ve been unable to submit a minor update for Geometry Stash. It&#8217;s unhelpful how the error states that &#8220;There was an error saving changes.&#8221; and that I&#8217;ve already contacted apple support.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-334" title="itc update error" src="https://i1.wp.com/apparentetch.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/itc-update-error.png?resize=500%2C382" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" />

Support replied that they were working on it but over a week has passed. I fired off another email asking about the issue&#8217;s status. This ITC updating issue should be relatively easy to fix. Let&#8217;s hope Apple gets its act together in time for New Years.

**Update **- 12/21/10: iTunes Connect Support replied informing me that my app&#8217;s screenshots appeared to be bad or missing. I reuploaded all of them and am still faced with the same error; contacted them again.
