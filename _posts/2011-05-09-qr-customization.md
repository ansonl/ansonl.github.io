We created a customized QR code for our front page website, [ApparentEt.ch][1].

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-683" title="etch qr code" src="https://i1.wp.com/apparentetch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/etch-qr-code.png?resize=250%2C249" alt="etch qr code" data-recalc-dims="1" />

Notes:  
Any greater of a gradient in the center of the image decreased the readability a lot; especially colored ones.  
It&#8217;s been confirmed to work with <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/at-t-code-scanner/id381292358?mt=8" target="_blank">AT&T Code Scanner</a> and <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/redlaser/id312720263?mt=8" target="_blank">RedLaser</a>.
