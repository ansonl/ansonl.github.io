It appears that the other iOS developers and I won&#8217;t need to.

From Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad-mini/from-the-app-store/" target="_blank">iPad mini page</a>:

> Apps made for iPad are made for iPad mini, too.

Combine that with similar words spoken during the reveal event today.

In other news, there was a collective sigh of relief from developers everywhere, dodging the bullet of rescaling their apps for yet another device with a new screen size.
