<p style="text-align: center;">
  Decided to take a picture of some new rating stars in the App Store lately.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  Old stars &#8211; for most apps and categories
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img class="aligncenter" title="old stars" src="https://i2.wp.com/apparentetch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/old-stars.png?resize=82%2C39" alt="old stars" data-recalc-dims="1" />
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  New stars &#8211; in the New and What&#8217;s Hot categories
</p>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-492" title="new stars" src="https://i2.wp.com/apparentetch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/new-stars.png?resize=79%2C43" alt="new stars" data-recalc-dims="1" />

<p style="text-align: center;">
  Perhaps these new stars are more appealing to the eye?
