  It&#8217;s been released on the same day as iCloud.<br /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956" title="Airport Utility on the App Store" src="https://i1.wp.com/apparentetch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Screenshot-2011.10.12-15.59.27.png?resize=384%2C261" alt="Airport Utility on the App Store" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br /> You can get it from the App Store <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/airport-utility/id427276530?mt=8" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>

I&#8217;ve added some screenshots below:  
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-961" title="Overview" src="https://i1.wp.com/apparentetch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/airport1.png?resize=208%2C299" alt="Overview" data-recalc-dims="1" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-962" title="Station info" src="https://i1.wp.com/apparentetch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/airport2.png?resize=250%2C242" alt="Station info" data-recalc-dims="1" />

The diagram looks similar to Windows&#8217; Network Connections page showing the Internet connected to the base station. Upon clicking the base station<!--more-->, you get general info on the white box.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-963" title="Firmware Info" src="https://i1.wp.com/apparentetch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/airport4.png?resize=225%2C208" alt="Firmware Info" data-recalc-dims="1" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-964" title="Connection Info" src="https://i1.wp.com/apparentetch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/airport3.png?resize=225%2C137" alt="Connection Info" data-recalc-dims="1" />

Click Version leads to a firmware options page with the ability of update the base station&#8217;s firmware. Wireless Clients gives you a list of current clients. Going deeper, you get connection details for each device, etc.

Apple is made Airport Utility for iOS easy for novices to use, yet powerful enough with ample stats for those with the need.
