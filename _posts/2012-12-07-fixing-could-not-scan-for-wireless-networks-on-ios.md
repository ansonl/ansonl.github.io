Today, the iPhone 5 would not show a list of wireless networks in the Settings App. When I tried to manually enter my network settings, it displayed a &#8220;Could not scan for wireless networks&#8221; alert.

This doesn&#8217;t seem to be a hardware issue. Instead it appears to be a problem with iOS software. A reset of Network Settings fixed the problem and the device was able to connect to wireless networks once the reset had completed.
