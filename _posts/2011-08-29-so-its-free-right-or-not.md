Apple launched iTunes Match beta and iTunes beta 6.1 with iTunes Match support.

The email sent out to developers says

 

> iTunes Match beta is currently available to developers in the United States. Beta subscribers will receive iTunes Match service during the beta period plus an additional 3 months for free with their 12 month paid subscription. To get started with iTunes Match, download the current version of iOS 5 beta and iTunes 10.5 beta 6.1 with iTunes Match. Once installed, choose Turn On iTunes Match from the Store menu, and click &#8220;Subscribe for $24.99.&#8221;

Apple usually doesn&#8217;t charge paid developers for access to its betas so the $24.99 subscription up front was a surprise to me. I would&#8217;ve expected them to give developers free access to iTunes Match until the beta ended. Were you surprised about this? Or do you not care about iTunes Match anyways.
