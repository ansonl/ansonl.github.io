Someone at Apple certainly didn&#8217;t think about iMessage and Airplane mode with Wifi turned on. Since iMessage requires an internet connection, a Wifi connection would suffice. <small><em>(As you can see, I&#8217;m on AT&T&#8217;s 200MB/mo plan)</em></small>

Also, downloadÂ <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cia-operation-ajax/id472099770?mt=8" target="_blank">Operation Ajax</a>, a comic depicting the actual 1953 US covert operation in Iran, in the iPad App Store for free while it lasts. It&#8217;s a great narrative of what went on in the 60&#8217;s. The comic lets on the United States&#8217;s dark side; its habit of playing chess with foreign nations.
