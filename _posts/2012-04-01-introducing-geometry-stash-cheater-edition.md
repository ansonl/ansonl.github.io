We are proud to release *Geometry Stash &#8211; Cheater Edition™*.

<div style="font-size: 12px;">
  <strong>Making the lives of students easier than ever.</strong>
</div>

Using the Apple iOS&#8217;s built in `UIDevice`API*, we can turn on monitoring of the devices&#8217; proximity sensor.

`[[UIDevice currentDevice] setProximityMonitoringEnabled:YES];`

<div style="font-size: 10px;">
  <em>*Use of this approved API makes cheating with Geometry Stash absolutely 100% legal. </em>
</div>

When the student places a finger over the device bodys&#8217; upper portion, the iOS system turns off the display as can be seen below.
