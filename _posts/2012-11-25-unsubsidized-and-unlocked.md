This seems to be widely known already, but buying an unsubsidized iPhone as &#8220;Device only/no contract&#8221; from an Apple Store gives you an unlocked iPhone.

You can buy one unlocked from Apple&#8217;s Canada Store; screenshot above. The unlocked option is not available in the US yet.

I was not too sure about a $700 GSM iPhone being unlocked when I went to buy one on Friday as result of[ The Great Chase][1].Â Internet sources said that a &#8220;Device only&#8221; purchase would be an unlocked device but Apple&#8217;s official stance was &#8220;your provider still needs to unlock it&#8221;.

Contrary to retail store employees&#8217; insistence that the iPhone is still locked to AT&T or Sprint or Verizon, the iPhone is unlocked once you restore it and the device&#8217;s IMEI is cross checked with Apple&#8217;s servers. I restored the device back at home (should&#8217;ve done it at the Apple Store) and iTunes displayed the message that the &#8220;iPhone is now unlocked&#8221;.
