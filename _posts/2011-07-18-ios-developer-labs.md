Apple has a <a href="http://developer.apple.com/labs/" target="_blank">Mac Developer Compatibility Lab</a>, but no equivalent for iOS devices. We&#8217;ve started the iOS Developer Compatibility Labs to fill the gap! You can get to our iOS Labs site [here][1].

&#8211; A deposit is made for each device  
&#8211; We ship the devices to the developer through Fedex (because they insure)  
&#8211; Every week a charge is deducted per device from the deposit.  
&#8211; Developer returns devices.  
&#8211; Security deposit, minus the weekly charges, is refunded.  
&#8211; Developer now knows how well his/her app performs on other devices.

&#8211; IF devices are broken or renter never returns them, then the appropriate repair is deducted from the deposit or we use the deposit to buy new devices. :)

We&#8217;re still starting up, so devices are made available on demand.
