If you updated Geometry Stash recently, you probably noticed an addition to the normal UI. We&#8217;ve added some Christmas decor to the app. The decorations, strung up lights, were actually used on our older flash-based, website. They happened to be in the right position for integration so we placed it right in. Luckily, the image doesn&#8217;t obstruct the other interface objects much. We created the decorations a year ago using Adobe Illustrator.

If you don&#8217;t like them, don&#8217;t worry, they&#8217;ll be gone after the holidays. ;]
