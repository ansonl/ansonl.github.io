Ever wanted to simply project an image onto an external display but there was no way to do it?

I created Image Out to solve that problem. The app allows you to select an existing image from your camera roll or take a photo using the device&#8217;s built-in camera.

Is your powerpoint or image on the internet? No worries, Image Out contains a translucent URL bar that can load images from over the internet. If the image is on its side, you can use the rotation tools to change the angle.

Here&#8217;s a picture of the app working with an external display. Just connect an Apple VGA Adapter and you&#8217;re good to go!

Image Out has been submitted to the App Store and will be available early next week.

*For those of you who say that the Photos app lets you do the same, the Photos app only displays the image to the external output when it&#8217;s in slideshow mode. The problem with that is that the pictures just keep on rolling by!*
