Every played Spybot: The Nightfall Incident?  
Some year&#8217;s back, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://lego.com">Lego</a> still hosted the Spybotics section on its website. However, it was taken down a few years ago and is skirting around the archives and some game sites.  
Spybot: The Nightfall Incident was one of the best games on Lego&#8217;s site. It&#8217;s no coincidence that the game was included in Jayisgames&#8217;s  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://jayisgames.com/archives/2006/01/best_of_2005_top20.php">Best of 2005: Top 20</a> and has gotten many other &#8220;awards&#8221; elsewhere. If you searched Spybotics, you would discover numerous users haplessly asking where the shockwave game went. They are all given the same answer: Spybotics is discontinued and Lego no longer hosts the game.  
I&#8217;d thought of creating &#8220;Spybot: The Nightfall Incident&#8221; for the iPhone before and I started out last Friday to bring it one step closer on the iPad.

View the video below for work so far.  
  
As you can see, I&#8217;ve scrapped together some resources and coded an access key retrieval level. Would be nice if I had all the original graphics files&#8230;

When finished, the game will be free as the shockwave game was free, too. Stay tuned for updates. I&#8217;ve contacted Lego Group about legal issues, but they haven&#8217;t replied yet. I&#8217;d really like to talk to them about some things.
