Google has been keeping data on sites which aren&#8217;t verified on Google Webmaster Tools all this time which isn&#8217;t such a bad thing as it sounds. I haven&#8217;t used Google Webmaster Tools in a while and decided to re-verify this site today.

    80% decrease in download time on 4/7

</div>

I began migrating the server and DNS from Hostmonster to Rackspace on 4/5 and got the majority of the website back up and running on 4/6. The 80% decrease in download time occurring on 4/8 was most likely Googlebot taking 48 hours to update its DNS records to point to the Rackspace server.

The pre-4/7/Hostmonster download time looks horrible in retrospect as the Rackspace server is much more responsive and isn&#8217;t a shared server. But two months ago, it seemed pretty dandy. I guess you really do get what you pay for. In my previous post on[ migrating from Hostmonster to Rackspace][1], my current plan on Rackspace is about 35% greater per year.

Was it worth it? I sure think so. I now have to freedom to configure the server with whatever I need. In the migration article, I also mentioned I am running Nginx on the Rackspace server to serve upÂ pages. Hostmonster uses Apache.

In 2011, Apparent Etch&#8217;s <a href="http://ansonliu.com/404" target="_blank">404 page</a> was featured on <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/01/16/funny-404-error-pages/" target="_blank">Mashable&#8217;s 33 More Entertaining 404 Error Pages</a>. It was also hosted on Hostmonster at the time. I remember the site slowing down and grinding to a halt for a few hours from a few hundred visitors (not completely sure due to lack of statistics, I checked Hostmonster&#8217;s AWStats for info back then).

Fast forward to this year, on 5/12 I posted a fun find in the SC2 Editor to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/1e7t4z/we_need_some_explaining_blizzard_bananas_in_my/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, I got about 15,000 views in the following 24 hrs. The lowest cost Rackspace server (1 CPU, 512MB RAM) handled the traffic spike without a problem. &#8230;Although the bandwidth charges should be interesting.
