Following the announcement of the Reminders app in iOS 5, we&#8217;ve made Automata free.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-751" title="reminders icon" src="https://ansonliu.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/reminders_icon.png" alt="reminders icon" width="62" height="62" />

If you don&#8217;t have access to the iOS 5 developer preview, you can use Automata to quickly set alerts until Reminders comes out in iOS 5.

Use Automata&#8217;s log, accessible through iTunes or iCloud, to keep track of your notifications and transfer them over to Reminders when the new OS is available.
