What your device runs out of juice mid update? It probably won&#8217;t, iOS 5 will remind you that your device must be at at least 50% battery or connected to a power source before beginning the update process.

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="update battery check.PNG" src="https://i2.wp.com/apparentetch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/update-battery-check.png?resize=512%2C177" border="0" alt="This update requires at least 50% battery or to be connected to a power source." data-recalc-dims="1" />

That&#8217;s not to say that you can&#8217;t download the update with less than 50% battery and then unplug your device from the power source after starting the update process.
