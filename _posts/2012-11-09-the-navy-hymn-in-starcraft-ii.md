In the cinematic &#8216;A Better Tomorrow&#8217; the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_Father,_Strong_to_Save#Marines" target="_blank"><em>Navy Hymn</em></a>/*Eternal Father, Strong to Save* plays in the background starting around 1:55.  
Apparently no one else has noticed the reference. The clip to the left starts playing where the hymn begins.
