If you like to mass quit apps on you device by using multiple fingers at once (three fingers works the best), you&#8217;ll need some practice to adjust for Newsstand apps.

I noticed that the NYTimes Newsstand app&#8217;s red quit button is slightly lower than the standard apps&#8217; quit buttons.
