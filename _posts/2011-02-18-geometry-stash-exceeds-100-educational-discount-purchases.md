Checked the Sales from yesterday, February 15th, 2011. 40 copies of Geometry Stash were downloaded by an educational institution for $0.99. Coupled with past downloads, educational discount purchases have well exceeded 100 copies, close to 200, I&#8217;d say.

Now I&#8217;d really like to chat with the aspiring educators who purchased Geometry Stash for their students! If you are one of them, let me know, please. ;)
