Earlier this week, my iPhone 4 running iOS 5 beta 1 &#8220;reset&#8221; itself. It kept my lock screen wallpaper and passcode but prompted me to set up the iPhone as if it were new once I typed in my passcode. After setting it up, the Apple logo was shown again and the home screen was briefly visible. Then the set up screen saying &#8220;slide to set up&#8221; was shown again. The setup screen reappeared every time like a loop. Apple probably changed something on their servers during this time or set a time bomb in the first beta. I was out of the country at the time of the problem so my device was reduced to an expensive paper weight. Since returning from Costa Rica yesterday, I&#8217;ve downloaded and restored to iOS 5 beta 5.

Â 

**Update:** It appears to have also happened to my iPad running iOS 5 beta 2.

Connecting the device to iTunes produced this message.

I can&#8217;t recall an expiration date stated on the developer website. Let me know if I am wrong.
