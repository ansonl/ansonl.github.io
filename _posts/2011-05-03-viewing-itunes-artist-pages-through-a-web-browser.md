I decided to stop using an accordion menu on the [ApparentEt.ch][1] site and have the &#8220;Created Apps&#8221; link to the iTunes page that would show all apps by Apparent Etch. However, not everyone has iTunes or wants it to open all the time.

iTunes now has a web based viewer where you can view apps and music. Good eh? So The Beatles have their own artist page that shows all their music sold on iTunes.

`http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/the-beatles/id136975`

But when you substitute in Apparent Etch like so,

`http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/apparent-etch/id324651855`

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-629" title="loading itunes page" src="https://i0.wp.com/apparentetch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/load-itunes-page.png?resize=396%2C204" alt="loading itunes page" data-recalc-dims="1" />

The result opens up a generic Opening iTunes page with the box and dot animation in the middle. <p style="text-align: center;">
  <!--more-->
</p>

Same goes for Firemint Pty Ltd&#8217;s link

`http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/firemint-pty-ltd/id306220443`

I&#8217;m guessing that only iTunes music artists get the web based Artist Page with a list of available works on it. I hope that Apple extends this feature to iOS app developers (artists — same thing on iTunes). People can quickly view the developer&#8217;s apps on a webpage in their browser rather than wait for iTunes — if they even have it — to start up and load. If the user is interested, then they&#8217;ll wait for iTunes to load. If implemented for developers, the web based Artist Page is a win-win for all parties in the long run.

Am I wrong? Tell me in the comments.
