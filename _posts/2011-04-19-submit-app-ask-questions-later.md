I&#8217;ve resubmitted Image Out, finally giving into Apple&#8217;s demands to remove the &#8220;iPad&#8221;, a rounded rectangle, from Image Out&#8217;s icon. Gaze:

Original icon  
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-595" title="old icon 114" src="https://i0.wp.com/apparentetch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/old-icon-114.png?resize=117%2C117" alt="old icon for image out" data-recalc-dims="1" />

Revised icon  
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-596" title="revised icon 114" src="https://i0.wp.com/apparentetch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/revised-icon-114.png?resize=114%2C114" alt="revised icon for image out" data-recalc-dims="1" />

Now, Apple&#8217;s reviewer also thought that the display was one of Apple&#8217;s Cinema Displays. When I drew the image, that thought never occurred to me, I was just drawing a good looking, generic display. As far as I know, Apple doesn&#8217;t own a patent or trademark on the look of a computer monitor.  
Especially on a black bezel and silver stand.

Heck, I could be depicting one of those <a href="http://www.amazon.com/HP-2210m-21-5-Inch-Diagonal-Monitor/dp/B003FMUL6S/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1303277788&sr=8-3" target="_blank">HP 2210m LCD monitors</a> among other <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Delectronics&field-keywords=dell+monitor&x=0&y=0" target="_blank">displays</a>

Heard nothing from the App&#8211; [kangaroo court] for almost a month.
