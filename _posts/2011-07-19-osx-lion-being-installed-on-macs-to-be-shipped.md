On Sunday, I ordered an iMac to replace my aging white Macbook. I expected that I would have to follow the instructions on <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/uptodate/" target="_blank">Apple&#8217;s OSX Up-to-Date</a> page. I configured the 21.5&#8243; iMac with a 2.8 i7 processor. At the time of placing my order, I saw that the delivery date was July 20-22. Thinking it was just that Apple would need more time to put in the i7, I just let it go.

However, considering that it&#8217;s the 19th today and tomorrow, the 20th, is when rumors point to as Lion&#8217;s commercial release date, maybe Apple is delaying shipments until the 20th in order to install OSX Lion on pending orders. Maybe they&#8217;ll just insert a drop in disk instead.

That happened when I bought my Macbook in 2007 on OSX Leopard 10.5&#8217;s release day. The box had a sticky on it with the label &#8220;Drop in&#8221; and an upgrade only disk for Leopard inside.

This afternoon, at 4, I checked my order again. It&#8217;s status was &#8220;Prepared for Shipment&#8221;. If tomorrow or the next two days really is (well, I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s one of them) Lion&#8217;s release date, then it would make sense for Apple to delay recent Mac orders to save customers the trouble to downloading the new OS from the Mac App Store.

**Update: Apple&#8217;s Peter Oppenheimer has confirmed that Lion will debut Wednesday on the Mac App Store.** *Source: Macworld.com*

**Update 2: Order shipped via Fedex Ground in Newark, CA. It&#8217;ll probably come tomorrow as we&#8217;re located in Fremont, CA. **

**Update 3: Came on the 20th. The iMac was not preloaded with Lion nor did it come with a drop in disk. We used Apple&#8217;s Up-to-date program to download Lion off of the App Store and we also made a bootable disk ourselves. ** *We just wrote a review on Lion; read it [here][1]. *
