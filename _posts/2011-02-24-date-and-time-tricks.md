The Fruit Ninja 1.6 update came out yesterday. Looking through some of the new blades and achievements, I saw Bamboo Shoot, a blade, and Night Shift, an achievement which could not be completed until tomorrow at the earliest. Bamboo Shoot required the user to play Fruit Ninja fruit days in a row. Night Shift required 3 games in between the hours of 3 and 5 am.

I remember when the first online &#8220;Mafia/Mobsters&#8221; game came out on the iPhone. It&#8217;s the type of game where you buy virtual goods, do missions, and &#8220;attack&#8221; others. That iPhone game had a part of the game where one could &#8220;own&#8221; property and gain interest over time. The first version of the game used the iPhone&#8217;s built in date to keep track of time elapsed. Users would just set their devices&#8217; year to 2035 and reap millions of virtual credits inside the game.  
I checked to see if this trick worked with Fruit Ninja. Funny enough, it worked and I got Bamboo Shoot and Night Shift in 10 minutes.

You can change your device&#8217;s time through Settings > General > Date & Time > Set Date & Time. &#8220;Set Automatically&#8221; may need to be toggled off to manually adjust time. Since I already got Bamboo Shoot, I wonder what would happen if one turned the date back half way through getting the blade. Advice for Halfbrick Studios would be to manage the date and time from a server to prevent tampering.
