## Block injected Comcast Xfinity Hotspot banners

Last year, I started using Multi-WAN with Comcast Xfinity Hotspot networks to increase my internet speed. A minor annoyance that I ran into was Comcast injecting the Xfinity Hotspot banner into the portion of my unencrypted HTTP traffic that went through the network interface using the ***xfinitywifi*** (Xfinity Hotspot) network. 

The Xfinity Hotspot banner appears like this

Upon loading a page, the banner will fade in over 2 seconds or so. Once it has faded in, you can click the in the upper right corner to dismiss it. If you misclick and end up clicking the rest of the banner or click before it has fully faded in, you will be redirected to an Xfinity upsell page in a new window.
