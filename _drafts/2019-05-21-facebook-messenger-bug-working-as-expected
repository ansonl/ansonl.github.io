## Facebook Messenger bug "working as expected"

**In short:** The Facebook Messenger *Hide Story From* setting exposes people who have unfriended you. You don't need to remember all your friends' names and look up every profile and friendship status because people who have unfriended you will show up as checked for *Hide Story From*. All the silently unfriended people will show up in a convenient list. 

This unexpected behavior can be triggered in the iOS Messenger app on at least v215.0. I have not tested on Android but expect it to work on the Android Messenger app as well. 

1. Open Messenger settings and select the Story row.
![]({{site.baseurl}}/test)

2. Inside the Story settings select the "Hide Story From" setting.

3. Note that any checked people (aka people who you thought were still Facebook friends) you haven't explicitly choosen to your hide story from have silently unfriended you in the past.

Unlike users keeping a copy of a past friend list and looking up the current friendship status of everyone, this bug requires no advance preparation or mass lookup of profiles either manually or API.

I reported this bug to Facebook's Bug Bounty because it is possibly a identification/deanonymization issue depending on various unfriend situations' social dynamic. 
While there is no technical "hacking" involved, the bug is more than just a harmless user interface bug .
