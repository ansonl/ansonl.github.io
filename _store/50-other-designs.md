## Purchase Prints

Purchase prints of any design I have created.

My designs can be viewed on the below sites:

- [MakerWorld](https://makerworld.com/en/@ansonl)
- [Printables](https://www.printables.com/@ansonl/)

My most popular designs are my 3D topography relief maps and car accessories.

See [Custom Design and Manufacturing]({% link _store/80-print-your-project.md %}) for more details.

## Commercial License for Released Designs

All Released Designs are free for personal use. Released Designs are my designs which have downloadable 3D files on a public website such as Makerworld and Printables.

If you are interested in selling any of my Released Designs, you can obtain a commercial license through my [Printables Club](https://www.printables.com/@ansonl/) membership.

## Commercial License for Other Designs
