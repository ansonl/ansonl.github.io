## Purchase Prints

Send me a message at [support@ansonliu.com](mailto:support@ansonliu.com) specifying which of my designs you want.

My designs can be viewed on the below sites:

- [MakerWorld](https://makerworld.com/en/@ansonl)
- [Printables](https://www.printables.com/@ansonl/)

My most popular designs are my 3D topography relief maps and car accessories.

If this is a custom map request, consider mentioning the region and your requirements. Pricing varies depending on the complexity of the map. E.g. An order based on one of my existing released designs will have a lower cost.

My hourly rate for design is $100/hr. Minimum order pricing starts at $300. Shipping and handling is generally free within the USA.

My [large California map design](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1170334-california-hex-puzzle-topographic-map-with-streams) is ~$300 (manufacturing, no additional design fee since it is an existing design) for reference.

### Licensed Sellers

I recommend getting my designs produced by any of my licensed sellers.
