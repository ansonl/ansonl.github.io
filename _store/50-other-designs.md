## Purchase Prints

Send me a message at [support@ansonliu.com](mailto:support@ansonliu.com) with your map idea and requirements.

Pricing varies depending on the complexity of the map. E.g. An order based on one of my existing released designs will have a lower cost.

My designs can be viewed on the below sites:

- [MakerWorld](https://makerworld.com/en/@ansonl)
- [Printables](https://www.printables.com/@ansonl/)

My most popular designs are my 3D topography relief maps and car accessories.

## Commercial License for Released Designs

All Released Designs are free for personal use. Released Designs are my designs which have downloadable 3D files on a public website such as Makerworld and Printables.

If you are interested in selling any of my Released Designs, you can obtain a commercial license through my [Printables Club](https://www.printables.com/@ansonl/) membership.

## Commercial License for Other Designs

Please email [support@ansonliu.com](mailto:support@ansonliu.com) to get terms for licensing the [Toyota Corolla Cross Hybrid Spare Tire Mount]({% link store.md %}).
