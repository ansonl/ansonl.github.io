## Purchase Prints

Purchase prints of any design I have created. 

My designs can be viewed on the below sites:

- [MakerWorld](https://makerworld.com/en/@ansonl)
- [Printables](https://www.printables.com/@ansonl/)

My most popular designs are my 3D topography relief maps and car accessories.

Send me a message at [sales@ansonliu.com](mailto:sales@ansonliu.com) and mention the design you are interested in.

## Commercial License for Released Designs

All released designs are free for personal use. Released designs are my designs which have downloadable 3D files on a public website.

If you are interested in selling any of my released designs, you can get a commercial license through my [Printables Club](https://www.printables.com/@ansonl/) membership.
