This spare tire mount allows you to store a compact spare wheel under trunk utilizing empty space.

- The mount attaches over the power cable disconnect lever in trunk.

- A spare tire can be placed on top of the mount which elevates the tire the minimum height needed to avoid excessive rubbing and tension on the power cable.

- Depending on the width of the spare, a spacer may be needed to elevate the cargo deck to be level with the top of the tire.

- The mount can be made in a specific color and material upon [request](mailto:support@ansonliu.com).

- ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Made in the USA.
