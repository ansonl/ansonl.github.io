### After

This spare tire mount allows you to store a compact spare wheel under trunk utilizing empty space.

- The mount attaches over the power cable disconnect lever in trunk.

- A spare tire can be placed on top of the mount which elevates the tire to minimize rubbing and tension on the power cable.

- Depending on the width of the spare, a spacer will be needed to elevate the cargo deck to be level with the top of the tire.

- The product will be made in a random color (probably black). Specific colors are available upon [request](mailto:support@ansonliu.com).

- üá∫üá∏ Made in the USA.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

**This kit does NOT include a spare wheel, jack, and spacer.** For information on getting a compatible spare wheel and jack and making your own spacer, see [this post]({% post_url 2024-05-23-corolla-cross-hybrid-spare-wheel-tire %}).

You must read and agree to the [Policy]({% link _store/99-store-policy.md %}) before ordering.

#### üîß Order Measurements

Include the following measurements with your order to get the best fit the first time:

- **Center Bore Diameter (mm)**

- **Hub Surface Depth (mm)** - The distance from the downward hub surface to the ground when the tire is laid on its side for storage. This is **not** the same as Wheel Backspacing because the rubber tire width must be considered. This can be directly measured with the tire (preferred) or estimated with the below equation:

  {% raw %}
  $$
  \text{Hub Surface Depth} = (\text{TireWidth} \div 2) + \text{WheelOffset}
  $$
  {% endraw %}

  - **Tire Width (mm)** - Tire width is ***XXX*** from the [DOT tire code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire_code) format ***XXX**/YYRDD*

  - **Wheel Offset (mm)** - Offset of the hub mounting surface relative to the centerline of the wheel. Positive offset is towards the street side. Negative offset is towards the car side. [Reference](https://www.lesschwab.com/article/wheels/what-is-wheel-offset.html)
