This spare tire mount allows you to store a compact spare wheel under trunk utilizing empty space.

- The mount attaches over the power cable disconnect lever in trunk.

- A spare tire can be placed on top of the mount which elevates the tire to minimize rubbing and tension on the power cable.

- Depending on the width of the spare, a spacer will be needed to elevate the cargo deck to be level with the top of the tire.

- The product will be made in a random color (probably black). Specific colors are available upon [request](mailto:support@ansonliu.com).

- 🇺🇸 Made in the USA.

### 🔧 Order Measurements

Determine which placement direction works best for your tire.

![Tire styles and recommended placements](/assets/images/store/tire-storage-direction.webp)

Placement A "deep dish up" is recommended when the rim protudes significantly from the tire (e.g. Toyota CC OEM Spare Tire).

Include the following measurements with your order to get the best fit the first time:

- **Center Bore Diameter (mm)** - The diameter of the center hole in the rim.

- **Hub Surface Depth (mm)** - The distance from the downward [hub](/assets/images/store/parts-of-a-wheel-rim_50perc.webp) surface to the ground when the tire is laid flat for storage.

  - 📏 Hub Surface Depth is most accurate when physically measured with the actual tire.

    > 1. Lay the tire flat.
    > 1. Measure the Hub Surface Depth to the floor.
    > 1. Flip the tire to lay flat on the other side of the tire.
    > 1. Measure the Hub Surface Depth to the floor.
    > 1. Use the lower of the 2 measured Hub Surface Depths.*
    > ###### *If the measured Hub Surface Depth is < 20 mm, the tire should be laid on the other side.

  - Hub Surface Depth can be estimated with the below equation.

  {% raw %}
  $$
  \text{Hub Surface Depth} = (\text{TireWidth} \div 2) + \text{WheelOffset}
  $$
  {% endraw %}

    > *Tire Width (mm)* - Tire width is ***XXX*** from the [DOT tire code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire_code) format ***XXX**/YYRDD*
    >
    > *Wheel Offset (mm)* - Offset of the hub mounting surface relative to the centerline of the wheel. Positive offset is towards the street side. Negative offset is towards the car side. [Reference](https://www.lesschwab.com/article/wheels/what-is-wheel-offset.html)

  - This is **not** the same as Wheel Backspacing because the rubber tire width must be considered.
