This spare tire mount allows you to store a compact spare wheel under trunk utilizing empty space.

- The mount attaches over the power cable disconnect lever in trunk.

- A spare tire can be placed on top of the mount which elevates the tire to minimize rubbing and tension on the power cable.

- Depending on the width of the spare, a spacer will be needed to elevate the cargo deck to be level with the top of the tire.

- The product will be made in a random color (probably black). Specific colors are available upon [request](mailto:support@ansonliu.com).

- 🇺🇸 Made in the USA.
