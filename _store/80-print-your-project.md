## Capabilities

### True Multi-Material/Color Printing

I utilize multi-extruder printers to minimize cross-contamination of different extruded materials.

Eliminating mixing of materials with a multi-extruder printer design has numerous advantages over single extruder designs.

- Stronger printed objects
- Removable supports
- Less wasted material
- Lower printing time + faster turnaround

### Materials

Object can be printed in a variety of and combination of multiple [materials](https://help.prusa3d.com/materials) including:

- PLA
- PETG
- TPU
- PC (Polycarbonate)
