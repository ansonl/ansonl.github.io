The modular device attachment point fits all devices with a common GoPro style mount. A blank universal mount is provided for customization for your device needs.

> Toyota Integrated Dashcam Mount is available on [MakerWorld](https://makerworld.com/en/models/447037) and [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/683181-2023-2024-toyota-integrated-front-windshield-mount).  
You may 3D print it for free. Please consider supporting my designs by becoming a member of my [Printables Club](https://www.printables.com/@ansonl).

If you power your device from the vehicle fuse box using a fuse tap, you may find my [Power Distribution Fuse Box Extended Cover](https://makerworld.com/en/models/227473#profileId-247602) useful for covering the fuse box if the original fuse cover is too low and no longer fits with the fuse tap inserted.

No suction cups or drilling required. This mount securely attaches directly to the existing TSS 3.0 bracket built into windshield.

I recommend the no frills Cobra CDR840 dashcam that is about $30 online. The CDR 840 records to a MicroSD card for reliable usage.
