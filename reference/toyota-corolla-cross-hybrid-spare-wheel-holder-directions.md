### Preparation

1. Park the vehicle on a level and dry surface. Ensure the vehicle is completely turned OFF and nonenergize for at least 10 minutes.

2. Open the rear cargo hatch.

3. Remove the cargo floor liner by lifting up on the rear edge and lifting it out of the vehicle.

4. Remove the foam block with Tire Puncture Kit from the vehicles.

### Power Connector

> Wear insulated gloves, shoes, and clothing. Ensure the work environment is completely dry before continuing.

1. Pry the black plastic retainer tab outwards from the white plastic lever with an insulated flat tool.

2. Disconnect the orange power cable connector in the center of the cargo space by lifting the white plastic lever upwards.

The diagram of the spare wheel well is oriented like above.

> **Avoid excessive force when handling the mount parts** If pieces fit too tightly, lightly tap a corner of the part with your fist or soft mallet.

#### Cable Disconnect-free installation (Unsupported)

If you do not want to disconnect the power connector to attach the tire mount, the lower member of **Part 1** can be removed with a fine-toothed saw and sanded smooth at the marked spots below to fit around the cable lever. **The tire mount will be weaker and less rigid with this method.**

### Tire Mount Disassembly

The parts may be shipped a single unit. Separate the parts in preparation for installation in the vehicle. If the parts are already separated from each other, proceed to [Tire Mount Assembly](#tire-mount-assembly).

1. The top circular piece (**Piece 3**) interlocks with the bottom 2 pieces with horizontal grooves running from left to right. Slide **Piece 3** to the left until **Piece 3** leaves the bottom 2 pieces as seen in the animation above.

2. The rectangular piece (**Piece 1**) interlocks with the semi circular piece (**Piece 2**) with a groove on the underside of the pieces. Slide the **Piece 1** upwards from **Piece 2** until the two pieces separate as seen in the animation above.

3. Unscrew and remove two M10 nuts on the underside of **Piece 1**.

4. Remove two M10 bolts and washers from **Piece 1**.

1. Slide **Part 2** (labeled "2") from left to right against the metal bracket underneath the power connector. The tongue on **Part 2** fits underneath the metal bracket's raised ridge.

    > ‚ÜòÔ∏è Tilt **Part 2** downwards towards the bracket (inboard) while ‚û°Ô∏è sliding the toungue underneath the bracket.

    ![3](/assets/images/reference/cch-tire-mount-assembly/3-p1-in-place.webp)

2. Lower **Part 1** (labeled "1a/1b") from above over the power connector and metal bracket. **Part 1** bottom should be flat against top of the the metal bracket.

    ![4](/assets/images/reference/cch-tire-mount-assembly/4-p1-bolts.webp)

3. Reconnect the orange power connector. Flip the white lever down. Pop the black clip back into the white lever.

4. Place a M10 washer over each of the two M10 bolts.

5. Insert the M10 bolts through two holes on the front and right sides of **Piece 1**. The shorter bolt fits in the front.

6. Tighten the two bolts to the metal bracket with two M10 nuts on the bottom face of the metal bracket.

   ![4](/assets/images/reference/cch-tire-mount-assembly/5-p3-in-place.webp)

7. Slide **Part 3** over **Part 1** and **Part 2** from the left. The grooves in the parts should fit into each other without excessive force.

> ü©π The non-metal parts in this kit can be patched with super glue.

### Spare Tire

![spare tire](/assets/images/reference/cch-tire-mount-assembly/6-tire-in-place.webp)

1. Lower [your spare tire]({% post_url 2024-05-23-corolla-cross-hybrid-spare-wheel-tire %}) centered above **Part 3** onto the mount. The tire rim center bore surface should be flat against **Part 3**. You may need to flip the tire to the other side to get an acceptable fit. The tire orientation depends on the geometry of your spare tire.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Spare rims with high offsets may touch the cable or sit very high. If this is the case, you may measure the additional height you need to raise the tire to clear the cable when placed "deep dish side down". Then place a circular wood or dense foam piece with height equal to the measured additional height amount in between **Part 3** and the rim as an additinal inside spacer. This may minimize the distance the cargo floor is ultimately raised by the spare tire. A longer tire hold down bolt may be needed after this modification.

> ‚öôÔ∏è **Part 3** may be customized by raising and lowering the top surface and making additinal cutouts made to better fit your specific tire. Customize and 3D print **Part 3** using the [released 3D model](https://makerworld.com/en/models/480955).

### Tire Hold Down

![tire hold down](/assets/images/reference/cch-tire-mount-assembly/7-tire-hold-down-above-tire.webp)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è You should use a matching **M8 threaded** tire hold down for your spare tire. **Part 1** and **Part 3** are threaded for M8 bolts.  
The Universal Tire Hold Down can be used if you do not have a matching hold down.

> ‚ö†Ô∏èüî© If you received multiple M8 bolts, you **must** try the **fully threaded and shorter** bolt first. Longer bolts can be tested if the shorter bolts do not get enough grip. Test longer bolts when **Part 1** is **NOT** attached to **Part 2**. If the bolt sticks out of the bolt hole underneath **Part 1**, the bolt is too long and must cut shorter.

> ‚ö†Ô∏èüî© Partially threaded bolts should only be used if **Part 3** has an unthreaded bolt hole. **Part 3 - low profile** has an unthreaded bolt hole. Screwing partially threaded bolts into threaded parts will wear out threads and preclude use of shorter bolts in the future.

1. Insert the M8 bolt into the tire hold down knob so that the hex head of the bolt fits into the hex cutout in the knob.

2. Insert the tire hold down ring into the tire rim center bore hole from above.

3. Insert the hold down knob with M8 bolt into the hold down ring. The flat surfaces of the knob will be flat against the interior circular cutout of the hold down ring.

4. Finger tighten the hold down knob by turning the knob clockwise and applying downward pressure to the hold down ring. Stop tightening the knob when resistance is encountered. Do not overtighten the knob or else **Part 1** and **Part 3** threads will be stripped.

5. If there is excessive play in the tire, repeat the previous step.

    > The plastic threads in **Part 1** are sufficient to hold the tire in place. If you strip the plastic threads in **Part 1**, the M8 nut cutout on the bottom of the **Part 1** may be enlarged to fit a M8 nut for an additional fastening point but this is untested.

### Cargo Deck Spacer

1. Measure the vertical distance between the highest point on the tire and the top surface of the plastic cargo deck floor on the left or right. This vertical distance (typically 1-2") is the thickness of the spacer needed for your combination of spare tire and vehicle.

2. Make a spacer using the dimensions in the [post]({% post_url 2024-05-23-corolla-cross-hybrid-spare-wheel-tire %}) as a general guide and tailor your measurements for any variations in your vehicle.

3. Make a circular cutout in the spacer for the circular holder located on the bottom of the cargo floor. This will help keep the floor and spacer aligned. You may create a [cargo deck hole buffer](https://makerworld.com/en/models/686847) out of flexible material (e.g. TPU, silicone) to distribute the shifting force of the cargo floor.

4. Put the spacer on top of the cargo deck.

### Finishing Up

1. Put the cargo floor on top of the spacer.

2. If you have a jack for your vehicle, the jack fits in the plastic cargo deck slot with the rubber band as a latch.

3. The Tire Puncture Kit consisting of a air compressor and tire sealant can be either removed from the car or placed under the cargo floor.

Additional vehicle accessories for the jack assembly, Tire Puncture Kit, and dashcam can be found in my released [vehicle accessories collection](https://makerworld.com/en/@ansonl/collections/1170762) and are available for custom order on the [Store]({% link store.md %}).
