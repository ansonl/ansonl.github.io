### Tire Mount Partss

> Avoid excessive force when putting the mount parts together. If tapping, lightly tap the pieces using a soft mallet and tapping block to avoid damage.

1. Slide **Part 2** (labeled "2") from left to right against the metal bracket underneath the power connector. The tongue on **Part 2** fits underneath the metal bracket's raised ridge.

    ![3](/assets/images/reference/cch-tire-mount-assembly/3-p1-in-place.webp)

2. Lower **Part 1** (labeled "1a/1b") from above over the power connector and metal bracket. **Part 1** bottom should be flat against top of the the metal bracket.

3. Reconnect the orange power connector. Flip the white lever down. Pop the black clip back into the white lever.

4. Place a M10 washer over each of the two M10x40mm bolts.

5. Insert the M10 bolts through two holes on the front and right side of **Piece 1**.

6. Tighten the two bolts to the metal bracket with two M10 nuts on the bottom face of the metal bracket.

7. Slide **Part 3** over **Part 1** and **Part 2** from the left. The grooves in the parts should fit into each other without excessive force.

### Spare Tire

![spare tire](/assets/images/reference/cch-tire-mount-assembly/6-tire-in-place.webp)

1. Lower [your spare tire]({% post_url 2024-05-23-corolla-cross-hybrid-spare-wheel-tire %}) centered above **Part 3** onto the mount. The tire rim center bore surface should be flat against **Part 3**. You may need to flip the tire to the other side to get an acceptable fit. The tire orientation depends on the geometry of your spare tire.

2. You can customize and 3D print **Part 3** using the released 3D model [here](https://makerworld.com/en/models/480955). The top of the part may be raised, lowered, and additional cutouts made to better fit your specific tire.

### Tire Hold Down

![tire hold down](/assets/images/reference/cch-tire-mount-assembly/7-tire-hold-down-above-tire.webp)

> ⚠️ You should use a matching **M8 threaded** tire hold down for your spare tire. **Part 1** is threaded for M8 bolts.  
The Universal Tire Hold Down part can be used if you do not have a matching hold down.

1. Insert the M8 bolt into the tire hold down knob so that the hex head of the bolt fits into the hex cutout in the knob.

2. Insert the tire hold down ring into the tire rim center bore hole from above.

3. Insert the hold down knob with M8 bolt into the hold down ring. The flat surfaces of the knob will be flat against the interior circular cutout of the hold down ring.

4. Finger tighten the hold down knob by turning the knob clockwise and applying downward pressure to the hold down knob. Stop tightening the knob when resistance is encountered. Do not overtighten the knob or else **Part 1** threads will be stripped.

5. If there is excessive play in the tire, repeat the previous step.

    > The plastic threads in **Part 1** are sufficient to hold the tire in place. If you strip the plastic threads in **Part 1**, the M8 nut cutout on the bottom of the **Part 1** may be enlarged to fit a M8 nut for an additional fastening point but this is not tested or recommended.

### Cargo Deck Spacer

1. Measure the vertical distance between the highest point on the tire and the top surface of the plastic cargo deck floor on the left or right. This vertical distance (typically 1-2") is the thickness of the spacer needed for your combination of spare tire and vehicle.

2. Make a spacer using the dimensions in the [post]({% post_url 2024-05-23-corolla-cross-hybrid-spare-wheel-tire %}) as a general guide and tailor your measurements for any variations in your vehicle.

3. Make a circular cutout in the spacer for the circular holder located on the bottom of the cargo floor. This will help keep the floor and spacer aligned.

4. Put the spacer on top of the cargo deck.

### Finishing Up

1. Put the cargo floor on top of the spacer.

2. If you have a jack for your vehicle, the jack fits in the plastic cargo deck slot with the rubber circle as a latch.

3. The Tire Puncture Kit consisting of a air compressor and tire sealant can be either removed from the car or placed under the cargo floor.

Additional vehicle accessories for the jack assembly, Tire Puncture Kit, and dashcam can be found in my released [vehicle accessories collection](https://makerworld.com/en/@ansonl/collections/1170762) and are available for custom order on the [Store]({% link store.md %}).
